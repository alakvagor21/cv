        <p>During my time at <em>Oregon State University</em>, I took an introductory SEO class which
        taught me the basics of writing searchable content for the web. It is a carefully thought out process
        but one that can lead to several rewarding outcomes if done correctly.</p>

        During my time at <em>Wake Forest University</em>, I studied Communication and minored in film studies.
        It was a challenging curriculum which lived up to the name <strong>Work Forest!</strong>. I learned a lot
        and miss Winston-Salem.

      <p>My time at Key WEst High School was a pretty normall college experience. I went to school, did my homework
      and played tennis. Had I known where I would end up, I would have learned how to code a  long time ago.</p>
